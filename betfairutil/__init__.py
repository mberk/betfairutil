    """
    Working out the total volume traded on a market is surprisingly tricky given Betfair's shenanigans around the market
    closure. Specifically, the last few updates in the price stream result in data getting zeroed out which means if you
    were to just look at the last available market book it would look like the total volume traded was zero. In fact, it
    appears there is no consistency as to how many price stream updates are involved in this zeroing of data and so it's
    not as simple as having a rule such as "look at the second to last market book available".

    If memory usage is not an issue then the most robust method would be to read the entire set of market books into
    memory then iterate them in reverse order looking for the first market book that has a non-zero total volume traded.
    However, in many use cases memory usage is a significant concern. For example, if you want to process tens of
    thousands of markets and use parallel processing to speed this up then you end up needing to hold the entire set of
    market books for multiple markets in memory simultaneously and, depending on the number of cores your machine has
    and the number of parallel processes you use, it is easy to exhaust the total memory available.

    The solution presented here is to use a deque
    (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque). Think of this as a limited length list
    where when a new item is appended to the list, another item is removed for the start of the list. This is used when
    reading the prices file to leave us with the X last market books which can then be iterated in reverse order to find
    the last one which has a non-zero volume traded. Based on my own analysis of prices files I have settled on a
    default maximum length of the deque of 8 - i.e. at most this function will store 8 market books in memory at any one
    time. This is a trade-off between giving correct results and drastically cutting down on memory usage versus reading
    the entire set of market books into memory. If memory usage is not of concern to you then you can simply set the
    deque_len argument to None and the function will read the entire set of market books into memory ensuring
    correctness. If you observe any prices files where a deque of length 8 doesn't give correct results then please
    create a GitHub issue here: https://github.com/mberk/betfairutil/issues so I can investigate.

    :param path_to_prices_file: Where the Betfair prices file to be processed is located. This can be a local file, one

    :param deque_len: The length of the deque used to limit memory usage when working out the total volume traded. See
        discussion above. This can be set to None to use the entire set of market books which should ensure correctness
